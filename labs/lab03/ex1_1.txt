1. What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.

These are assembler directives. They do not generate instructions, they tell the assembler where and how to place things in memory.
Assembler directives are instructions to the assembler, not to the CPU.
They tell the assembler how to build the program in memory, rather than telling the processor what to execute at runtime.
Assembler directives control layout, data, and metadata at assembly time; they do not execute.

What assembler directives do:
    Assembler directives can tell the assembler to:
        Choose which memory section to use
        Allocate memory
        Initialize data
        Define constants
        Align data in memory
        Declare labels and symbols
    All of this happens before the program runs.

.data
    Corresponds to data segment

    Switches the assembler to the data segment
    Used to store static/global data
    Memory here is:
        Allocated before the program runs
        Has a fixed address
        Typically read/write
.word
    Allocates one or more 32-bit (4-byte) words
    Stores the given values in memory
    Used for:
        Integers
        Arrays
        Constants
.text
    Corresponds to text (code) segment

    Switches the assembler to the text segment
    Used for executable instructions
    Memory here is:
        Typically read-only
        Executed by the CPU
    All instructions after .text go into the instruction memory.

.data               <- switch to data segment
.word 2, 4, 6, 8    <- Creates 4 consecutive words in memory
n: .word 9          <- n is a label pointing to an address in the data segment. That address stores the integer 9
. text              <- switch to text (code) segment

Putting it all together (mapping to memory)
    | Directive | Memory Section | Purpose                             |
    | --------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
    |  .data    | Data segment   | Static variables, constants         |
    |  .word    | Data segment   | Allocate & initialize 32-bit values |
    |  .text    | Text segment   | Program instructions                |

One-sentence summary
    .data selects the data segment for static variables,
    .word allocates 32-bit values in that segment,
    and .text selects the text segment where executable instructions are stored.
